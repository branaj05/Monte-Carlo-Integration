# Monte-Carlo-Integration
The Goal is to use an integration method that plots random numbers within some square area.
If I plot a million points within my area, compare the point's position with f(x), and find the ratio of above
vs below f(x) I can find what percentage of my square area is underneath f(x). This method is great for dealing with
sudden/irregular functions
